Take the right exit of Tonkiness, as soon as you reach to the next map area
you will encounter your first battle.


Fighting Tips
=============
Arche will give let you know of the controls of basic combat. When playing
Fortune Summoners, I do not recommend button mashing, because of the slow 
animation recovery per attack, you will most likely be killed if you're 
spamming attacks. Learn to use your attacks and time your guard by pressing up.
Because Auto Guard is not reliable.



After defeating the two Slimes, Sana will join your party. Now keep taking the
east exit until you reach to the school.

Kill the slimes and take the exit on the right.  The north exit here leads to
a dead end that contains a treasure chest with one herb inside. Now return
to the previous area, and wait till the moving platform, and hop on. Head 
for the next area. You should try to be careful in this room, because there
is  more then two monsters which can be difficult for first time players. 
Defeat the monsters and take the exit on the right. Go near the water, Arche
will  notice that its a dead end and Colm and friends will show up. Now leave 
the cave and return home. Talk to Arche's mother, then go to the third floor
and sleep.

OPTIONAL
========
You can take the left exit out of Tonkiness. By reaching to bridge area, you
can obtain three items that can be somewhat helpful, but I recommend not 
doing it because you will have to defeat four sets of Mothbees twice in 
order to get it. Its best to come back here when you're stronger.

Go to the school and take the gate exit to the Stables. Talk to Sana to
recruit her into your party. Then go back to the cave you explored yesterday.
Head to the dead area with the large pool of water. Sana lets Arche know that
her elemental stones allows her to breathe underwater. Switch to Sana and 
travel underwater and press the switch at the end of the other side. Head to
the nextarea, the upper path contains a chest with Cloth Armor, so take the 
upper path first. Then return back to the previous area and take the bottom
path to go to area 8. Go to your left side, and push the wood crate and use it
to jump and on the moving platform, this will lift the steel platform up. 
Switch to your other character and press the switch near the steel platform.
Return to the previous area, you will notice the wall on the left end is gone.
Take the left exit to area 9, take the first exit on your right will lead you
to area 10 which has a chest that contains a Good Child Drop. The second exit
will have a large door you can't open and two treasure chests beside it. 
Try to exit through the large door. Sana will tell you to go home.

Talk to Ms. Sophia and answer "yes". Leave the classroom and return home. Talk
to Arche's mother. Then go to the first floor and enter the storage room.
Examine the pot on the very left. You will an Old Key. Now remember that door

enter that door.

Take the left exit to go to area 2, then enter the first door you see, next
enter the first door you see again. You will find two treasure chest, open
the one on the right which contains a Green Smock. Do not open the treasure
chest on the left (Poison Trap). Now head back to area 2 and the second door

The Skeleton has a very quick attack speed which is extremely annoying. If
you keep on defending, the Skeleton will do a leap attack which breaks your
guard. Have Arche to use wide thrust to keep it away from Sana, until she can
cast Diamond Dust to do heavy damage to the Skeleton. When the Skeleton is in 
its casting animation, it will cast it's sleep spell. You can cancel this by
attacking the Skeleton, or avoid it by jump of out the Skeleton's range. 


Once you defeated the Skeleton, take the exit in the right. After the event
exit the room.

to the area where Arche's House is and go to the house beside the item shop.
Talk to the Old Lady, she will give you a handmade lunch. Deilver it to the
guard.

Now take the left exit out of Tonkiness, run all the way to where the broken

Use Sana to travel underwater and run to the other side. Press the switch
then enter the next area. Take the left exit from here, there is a Mark of
Heroism right in this room. Return back to the previous area, the first room
you can enter contains two treasure chest, but you need to use Sana by herself
due to the water below. Now go back to the previous room, and kill all the
snakes on the top platform, and use Arche to push the crate down. Push the
crate to the blue switch to unlock the path on your right. Run all the way
to the next area. Until you have reach to the area where there multiple
lift platforms. Jump all the way on the center, if you go to the left area
first, there is treasure chest containing a Leather Armor. Return back to
where the center door is. Take the right path from here on, once you reach to
a large pool of water, you will have to switch to Sana. You will find a 
switch at the very end near where the cart is. Press the switch to drain
the water. Then switch back to Arche and push the cart, so you can use it
as platform to reach to the next area. Take the top path to reach to the
next area, then when you see the first door you can enter, you can find
a Mark of Heroism on the right exit. Go back to the previous area and take
the other exit. On the next area its very dangerous, because you will have
to switch to Sana to find the switch to drain the water. Once you found
the switch on the other side, switch back to Arche, there's a cart that
you will have to use as a platform to make it to the switch on the top. Once
you have hit that switch, you will have to backtrack all the way  back to
Area 8 (area where the first cart is). On the left side, you will now notice
the water is drain, use Arche to push the block away. This door will lead
you to the boss room.

|Lead Merkid    | 179	  | Splash					     |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The leader Merkid has two Merkid along with him. Its a rough battle to start,
make sure you kill the Mage Merkid first, because the Mage Merkid have the
lowest HP and also can cast all kinds of nasty spells. Once you finish
all the Merkid's sidekick, the battle should be breeze. Just keep attacking
the leader Merkid and have Sana cast her spells.


Once you have defeated the boss, take the right exit, you will find another
Mark of Heroism. Continue forward and obtain the Crest of Wind. Now return
home.




~Day 6~ 	3G


Go to Sana's house and speak to Sana's mother. Leave Tonkiness and head to
school. Talk to Ms. Sophia at the Headmaster Office. Speak to all the student
in class and then leave. 




Run back to Tonkiness village. Then take the left exit. Keep on running 
through the left path, you will notice the bridge is now fixed, keep
running on left. When the path begins to split, take the left path to get
to Weathervane Tower. You will notice Colm and friends are here. Talk to
them, then go back to the area where the path begins to split. Take
the upper path, until you have reach to Barness village.

The game will then switch to Stella's point of view. Take the exit on the 
center of Chartreux City, and then take the exit at the far to reach to the
Mayberk Manor. Enter the mansion and then leave speak to Rowen and leave.
Now take the right exit out of Chartreux City. Keep running right until
you make it to Barness Village. There is an inn inbetween the roads, that
you can stop by for a rest. 


*If you want the Memory Photo 3 item, you will need to backtrack to the first
cave where the school is. There is a treasure chest that can only be access 
with Stella.



** Using Stella **

Stella plays very similar to Sana, she has better melee properties and
use all attack spells. Try to keep enemies at a distance and cast your
magic. The best way to deal with monsters is to use her Fire Handling
attack, (Direction key plus Attack).  This does a fair a bit of damage
without consuming MP. Once you have reach level 4, you can use Stella's
Chaser ability, this can literally kill every monster you encounter in 
one cast.

For Stella you will have to take a different path because Stella cannot push
heavy objects. Start by taking the right exit, use Stella's Fire Handling skill
to burn through the vines then exit out. Stella's route in pretty straight
forward, on the next room, light up the torches to open the door. Then
you can continue straight to a dead end for a some healing items. Take the
bottomless pit on the far end there is exit you can take to get to the next
area. In the this room there is a switch that contains the mark of Club, find
it in the center left side of the room, press it and the barricade on the upper
left exit is gone. Take this exit and you will be back where Stella encounters
Arche.


The game will shift back to Arche's point of view. Go open the large door
Watch the event with Stella.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stella is a pretty easy boss. Your normal attacks usually interrupt her spell
casting. Just keep on attacking her and prevent her from using her spells
and the battle should end fairly quick.




Leave the dungeon, and then exit out of Barness Village. As you try to go home
through the field map, an event with Colm and a doctor with appear. Backtrack
back to Barness Village and enter the first house you see. Speak to the man
inside and take the backdoor out of his house. Run to the end and enter the
cave.

Start by going to the left side, you will see a large cart, destroy the crates
beside it, but make sure you leave one crate. Push the cart against the right
wall, then push the other crate next to the cart. Use the he crate to jump on
to the cart and get to the next area. Keep on running right until you find
two exits, going to the right exit will take you to a dead end with a chest 
that contains a better herb. Go back to the previous room and take the first
exit in the center. Fall down and you will find two exit, take the left exit
first. In this room use Stella to jump on the moving platform and burn the
vines. The chest in this room contains Memory Photo 4. Return to the previous
room and take the other exit. Keep running left until you find a path blocked
by vines, use Stella to burn it, then switch to Arche and push the iron block
on to the blue switch. This should remove the wood barricade on the right side.
The exit beside the wood barricade,  contains a Strongirl Juice. Now take the
right exit out of of the map. In this room there is three switches you will
have to find, there is one in the upper right side of the map, one in the
middle right and the last one is in the bottom left side. Use Stella to light
up the switches, this will remove the wood barricade on the left center of
the map. From here on its pretty straight forward just keep going forward
until you find the exit to the next room. Just before you go to the boss room
you should take the exit on the right, because there is a save point and a
mark of Heroism.

|Baby Mage      | 400	  | Heal Water/ Diamond Dust / Shield /		     |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


This boss can be very annoying or very easy depending on how fast you can
take down the two Kobolds with him. Have Stella cast Phoenix and you able
to take the Kobolds with a single hit. Then Focus on the Baby Mage. Baby Mage
cast exactly the same spell set as Sana, and is very annoying, when its HP
drop below 60% it will try to cast Heal Water to heal himself. Sometimes
the Baby Mage will put on shield which will prevent you from dealing high
physical damage to it. Just keep it at bay with Arche and have Stella cast
Chaser.



Once you have defeated the Baby Mage, go to the next room and take the herb.
Now leave the dungeon and watch the event.







~Day 7~ 	3H




Talk to Colm and company and leave the school. Return home and speak to 
Arche's Mother. Now take the west exit out of Tonkiness. You can either back
track to Barness for the treasure items you couldn't get with Arche before
or you can go to the next destination.

Fall down and take the left exit, keep on moving until you see an exit on the
bottom path. Take the bottom exit, on this room head for the right exit 
(Poison Trap on the left treasure chest). You'll find a Mark of Heroism and
also switch that opens the Sun door. Now return to the previous room and tak	e
the exit on the upper left path. Go all the way to the bottom and you
can see the path where the barricade block with the Sun symbol is open. Go
take the exit from there. Run to next room on your left. In this room if goxc
down the bottom, you can see three large platform carts. Kill all monsters 
and push all three carts to a point where all three is spread evenly. Then
run to the top and hop the top of the carts to make it across the next room.
In this room, use Sana to cast Mermaid Robe on Arche and go underwater, when
you reach to the other side, there is two exit, the first exit will take you
to a treasure room and the other will take you to the exit of Carudale Tunnel.
Push the boat on your right to obtain two treasure chest.



Take the left exit until you have reach to Chartreux City. Go to Candy Store
(Last house on the left side of the map) Talk to the shop owner, then leave
and go to the back side of Chartreux City. Run to last house (The one just 
past the mansion)and talk to the kid upstairs. Run back to the Bakery near
the entrance of the City. Talk to the shop owner and get the Handmade Tart.
Go back to the Candy Kid and trade him the Handmade Tart. Return home and
talk to Arche's mother then go upstairs and sleep.





~Day 8~ 	3I


Leave the school and take the right exit out. Remember that area where the
Guard won't let you pass? Take that route to Korat Village. There is gate
that leads to another area and a save point with the healing witch near
the beginning, but continue straight on ahead and around midway through, 
an event will occur. Sana will be kidnapped and you will need to backtrack 
to that Gate area near the healing witch. Enter here and take jump the
platforms to reach higher ground and take the right exit. There is a cave
that leads you to Org Lair hidden underneath one of the platforms, but
I recommend taking the right exit first, in the right exit there is a
a merchant selling healing items. Make sure you stock up alot of herbs,
because the next destination is extremely dangerous.

Start by jumping on the two platsforms and then use the trap platform to lift
you up to the next room. In this room, keep going straight, do not enter the
first exit you see, but jump on the platforms and go for the right exit. This
is basically a detour to get you the Org Slayer which is very handy for this
dungeon. Run to the left side and fall down. Then take the exit on the left 
door.

Now on here in this room there six lifting platform, when you jump on the 
second last platform, stand there for a very short time to raise the last
platform up, and jump on it to reach to the next room.

*The Timing is very strict here on jumping the platforms.


In this room there is a Tough Drop and pass the water there lies a chest
that contains the Org Slayer. Run back all the way near the beginning and take
the exit that I tell you not to take earlier. 


In this room you will notice the path is split between up and down, take the
path on the bottom, because the upper path is a deadend. On the next room,
jump up to the top, you will find a switch, push the statue on to the switch.
This will open the barricade on the bottom of the map. In the center right
there is a chest that contain a Power Drop. Drop down to the bottom and open
the door to your left. This room is pretty large, first jump up to the platform
on the right and then jump on to higher platform on the left, keep going up
until you find a door on the left. In this room you will find a cart, push the
cart against the wall on the right, then jump on the top of the cart and push
the statue on to the cart. Push the cart from the bottom, until its up against
the platform on the center. push the statue out of the cart on to the center
platform. Then push the cart from the bottom, until reach to the left end
of the center platform. Now push the statue on to the cart and push the cart
to the left wall. Now push the statue on the blue switch. This switch will
activate the lifts on the previous map. Jump on to the lifts and make to the
room on the right exit. From here on just keep going straight. There will
be also a save point nearby.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is probably the easiest boss fight in the game. All because you have a
full party. Now with Stella and Sana in your party, you should be unstoppable.
If you found the Org Slayer in the dungeon, Arche should deal very high
damage to the the Boss Org and his minions and with Stella's fire magic, they
will drop very quickly.



Leave the dungeon and head for the road to Korat Village. 


*New field theme plays when you have all three party members in your party.

Once you make it to Cranbal Valley, go find the cave below the cliff and
enter.  Inside the cave there is is an exit on the bottom left corner,
take this path until you have found the Mark of Heroism. Once you find the
Mark, backtrack back to the first room and take the exit between the center.


You will be back in the fields, around halfway through the map, switch to 
Sana to travel underwater, and find another cave nearby. In this cave, take
the left exit first. This will lead you outside beside a switch with a diamond
symbol. Turn it on, this will activate the lifts, giving you a shortcut for
going back. Return back to the cave and take the exit on the right side.
Jump up the cliffs and head for the right exit until you have reach to Korat
Village.

A very easy boss fight. The Great Scorpion can use its pincer to attack which
can cause poison very easily. But this boss fight doesn't last too long due 
it's poor defense against magic attacks. Just have your party member cast 
their magic spells and the battle should finish in no time.




Watch the event and now you can enter that locked area right on the first top
exit of the tunnel.

This is one of the tougher dungeons found in the game. Beware of the steam that
come in all different directions. Start the area by running to the right area
until you enter the next room. You should find a Mark of Heroism in there.
Leave the room and return to the entrance. Run all the way down and enter the
next area. Starting here, the paths gets split into two paths, take the right
path first, in here you will enter a large area with treasure chest scatter in
different sections of the area. Return to the previous area once you have
obtain all the treasures. Now take the exit on the center. Start by going 
towards the right side, you will find a switch that opens the gate with the
sword symbol. Now run all the way to the bottom, and take the exit on your 
right. In here the path is split into, one in the left side and one on the 
right, don't bother going to the left area until you have explore the area
on the right side first. 

From here, go all the way down the bottom, and take right path to the
next room. Get the treasures and then, run down the take the exit on the
bottom left section of the bottom. Now run to the left exit again, now go
all the way down to the bottom. Push the blocks to prevent the steam from
coming and then enter the room on your right. Right to the right exit again.
This area, you will find a switch and a block. Have your party member stand
on the block, and then when you push the switch, it will move the block,
however watch for the steam, as the steam will knock your party member down
the platform, leading you to start the puzzle from scratch, so have your 
timing done correctly. (My method, is avoid the first two sets of steam and
then switch to the party member on the platform and jump over) Now hit
the swtich with the club symbol. You will now need to backtrack, all the
way back to the area where you pushed the blocks to blocked the steam. Now
go all the way up and find the exit on the upper left section of the map.
Keep on continuing forward from here on, the Switch with the Club symbol should
have activated the lift here, just keep running to the next exit until you
reach the boss room.

\     Arche     /
 ===============

Overview: The main protagonist is like the typical Tank class of MMOs. A 
physical damage dealer that shields caster. Arche is the easiest character
to use and moves very similar to a fighting game character. Arche will gain
the use of magic near the end of the game. Although Arche only has two magic
in the entire game, these two magic skills are extremely strong that can almost
make Arche into a broken character.
